        "summary": "The game pits two teams—the Counter-Terrorists and Terrorists—against each other in objective-based game modes. The most common objectives are bomb defusal and hostage rescue, each with designated maps. Players begin with a knife and pistol in each round; however, they can purchase weapons and equipment from the buy menu. They can earn money through eliminating an enemy or accomplishing a goal, but are fined for injuring a teammate if friendly fire is enabled. If eliminated, players do not respawn until the end of the round.",
